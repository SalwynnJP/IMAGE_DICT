# Creating the First Image Dictionary for Yomitan 📸

We utilize Python scraping methods to collect a myriad of images from "irasutoya.com" and potentially expand our sources later on.

## Accomplished:
We've successfully retrieved all the images from "irasutoya.com" 🎉
## To-do:
Next up, we'll sanitize the data and organize them into a dictionary format and we will make another script to get all the images from the links we got from the "irasutoya.com" scrap 📝
